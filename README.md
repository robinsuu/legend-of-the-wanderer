> The story behind the game

I was learning how to program by myself back in 2014, and decided to make something of my own. Armed with little more than a book about basic Java programming, I started making my first somewhat big program. I have always liked text adventures like the old MUD games, so I decided it would be a perfect way of learning programming since I would not have to program any graphics.

I made a few prototypes and a somewhat working console game for version 1 until I decided I wanted to try and integrate the app in a GUI. Thus, version 2 was created. All in all it took roughly 6 months to make the game on my free time.

In 2017 I decided to go back and revisit this project to clean it up and fix some critical bugs. It is still a program filled with strange decisions and a lot of bugs, but I like to keep it around to remind myself of how much you can make with pure motivation, and how much my programming knowledge has improved since then.
