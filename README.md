# Legend of the Wanderer
> Text based single player adventure

This is one of my earliest Java projects. It was built before I had any formal training in programming. I like to look back on it to see how long I have come since this time, but also to see how much is possible with nothing but imagination and determination. Even though the code looks like it does, I'm still surprised it was possible to hack something together with this little knowledge.

> System requirements

Tested on Windows 7/8/8.1/10 and Mac OS Sierra.

You need at least Java version 7 installed.

> Play the game

You can download the game here: https://github.com/robinsuu/legend-of-the-wanderer/blob/master/dist/Legend2.1.zip

Please refer to the documentation provided or type "help" once inside the game for instructions on how to play it. The controls are a bit funky, but I hope you will enjoy it anyway!

> The story behind the game

I was learning how to program by myself back in 2014, and decided to make something of my own. Armed with little more than a book about basic Java programming, I started making my first somewhat big program. I have always liked text adventures like the old MUD games, so I decided it would be a perfect way of learning programming since I would not have to program any graphics.

I made a few prototypes and a somewhat working console game for version 1 until I decided I wanted to try and integrate the app in a GUI. Thus, version 2 was created. All in all it took roughly 6 months to make the game on my free time.

In 2017 I decided to go back and revisit this project to clean it up and fix some critical bugs. It is still a program filled with strange decisions and a lot of bugs, but I like to keep it around to remind myself of how much you can make with pure motivation, and how much my programming knowledge has improved since then.
