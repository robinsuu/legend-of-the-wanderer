#0404 A corridor lit up by torches. You are almost caught as a guard patrols past a parallel corridor. You'd better pick a less patrolled way.
#0405 The bottom of a rusty staircase. It's very dark in here so you light a torch and bring it with you.
#0406 You twitch for every step you take as it sounds like the staircase will fall apart any moment.
#0407 If only this staircase wasn't so incredibly noisy.
#0408 One of the steps suddenly break and goes crashing down into the darkness with a loud noise! You barely hold on to the railing and have to stop and catch your breath for a moment before continuing. Whew!
#0409 You start asking yourself why you'd have to bring food for a week as you continue your struggle in the almost unusable staircase.
#0410 Oh well, at least you'll be losing some weight walking these cursed stairs.
#0411 Whatever you do, don't look down.
#0412 This section is missing the railing so you brace yourself and carefully traverse it.
#0413 Why can't this staircase from hell end soon?
#0414 This section is missing a few steps, so you take a leap, crashing into the other side making a loud noise. If the guards weren't alerted by your presence yet, they've surely been now.
#0415 You see a door letting out some light further up.
#0416 The top of a rusty staircase. There is a large circular room to your south.
#0417 The entrance of a circular room unlike anything you have ever seen before. The black stone floor is polished to a mirrorlike finish and the ceiling consists of dark red crystals in all kinds of irregular shapes. As soon as you enter the room you get an almost suffocating feeling. Something is very wrong with this place.

#0430 The entrance of a peaceful garden.
#0431 It's very peaceful here. You notice a broken swing hanging from a tree.
#0432 This spot looks like a small training ground for fencing. Why don't you try 'k' or 'kill'ing a practice doll? You could also 'cons' or 'consider'.
#0433 Taking a stroll in the garden. The fountain is gushing out fresh and sparkling water. Why don't you try 'in' or 'interact'ing?
